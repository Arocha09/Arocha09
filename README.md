👋 Hi, I’m Aiden

I’m a Master’s student in Data Science at the University of Virginia (Class of 2026) with a background in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I’m actively learning, experimenting, and refining my skills across machine learning, data engineering, and applied AI, with a particular interest in how models move from theory to real-world systems.

My work so far spans ML modeling, deep learning, RAG-based LLM systems, and full-stack data applications, but I approach each project as part of an ongoing learning process, testing ideas, comparing approaches, and improving through iteration. I’m especially drawn to projects that sit at the intersection of data, systems, and human-centered problems, including education, audio/signal processing, and decision support tools.

This GitHub is a living workspace: a place where I document projects, coursework, experiments, and ideas as I continue to grow as a data scientist and engineer.

📚 Currently learning: advanced ML, data engineering workflows, and scalable AI systems

🔍 Interested in: applied ML, predictive modeling, RAG/LLMs, and data-driven decision making

🚧 Always building, always iterating
